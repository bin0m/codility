# Write a function:
# def solution(A)
# that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
#
# For example, given:
#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 6
#   A[3] = 4
#   A[4] = 1
#   A[5] = 2
# the function should return 5.
#
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
#
# Complexity:
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
# Elements of input arrays can be modified.


def solution(A):
    n = len(A)
    count = [False]*n
    for element in A:
        if 1 <= element <= n:
            count[element-1] = True
    for index in range(1, n+1):
        if count[index-1] == False:
            return index
    return n+1

print(solution([1456546546, 1]), "(Right answer: 2)")
print(solution([1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]), "(Right answer: 5)")
